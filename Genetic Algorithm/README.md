Aspect | Traditional Algorithms	| Genetic Algorithms (GA)
|--|--|--|
Approach | Rule-based, deterministic | Inspired by natural selection; probabilistic
Problem Type | Well-defined problems with known rules | Complex, non-deterministic, combinatorial optimization
Exploration vs Exploitation	| Primarily exploitation | Balanced mix of exploration and exploitation
Search Space | Exhaustive or predefined strategy | Stochastic exploration of large solution spaces
Convergence	| Typically converge to a single optimal solution | May converge to multiple or diverse solutions
User Intervention	| Minimal	| Requires tuning of parameters (mutation rate, crossover rate, population size)
