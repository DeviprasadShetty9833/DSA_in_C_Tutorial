  <summary>Click to expand 🔻</summary>

<br> 🟠 Data structures can broadly be classifed into two categories:
  
```html

1. Primitive Data Structures
   • Basic data types that are directly operated upon by machine-level instructions.
   • Examples: Integers, Floats, Characters, Strings, and Boolean.

2. Non-Primitive Data Structures
   • More complex data structures built using primitive data types.
   • Examples:
      - Linear: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List.
      - Nonlinear: Tree, Graph.

```

</details> 

<br> ![1.4](https://img.shields.io/badge/_1.4_-Types_of_Data_Structures-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)   

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand 🔻</summary>
  
```html

1. Linear Data Structures:
   • Data is arranged sequentially, and each element is connected to its previous and next element.
   • Examples: Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists.

2. Nonlinear Data Structures:
   • Data is arranged in a hierarchical manner, with no strict sequence.
   • Examples: Trees, Graphs.

3. Static Data Structures:
   • Fixed size; memory is allocated at Compile-time.
   • Example: Array.

4. Dynamic Data Structures:
   • Flexible size; memory is allocated and deallocated at Runtime.
   • Example: Linked List.

```

<br> ⏺️ Linear data structures organize data in a sequential manner, where elements are arranged in a line. 

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand 🔻</summary>

<br> 🟠 Key Characteristics:

```html
1. Elements are stored consecutively.

2. Traversal is straightforward (one-dimensional).

3. Fixed or variable size.

```

🟠 Examples:

<table>
<tr><td>

1. Array: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations.

```html

Merits:

- Data is Homogeneous

- Size of Array is known.

- For fast Access through Indexing.

- contiguous memory blocks.

Demerits:

- Fixed Size, Wastes memory or Overflows. (✅ Linked List / Dynamic Arrays like Python’s list)

- Inserting / Deleting at the beginning or middle requires shifting elements. (✅ Use Linked List / Deque / Dynamic List)

Operations:

- Accessing: Constant time (using index).

- Searching: Linear search (O(n)) or binary search (O(log n) for sorted arrays).

- Insertion/Deletion: Expensive in terms of shifting elements.

Applications: Used in matrices, image processing, and database indexing.

```

2. Stack: A collection following the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. 

```html

Operations:

- Push: Insert an element.

- Pop: Remove the top element.

- Peek: View the top element.

Applications: Used in recursion, expression evaluation, and undo functionality.

```

3. Queue: A collection following the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. 

```html

Types:

• Simple Queue.

• Circular Queue.

• Priority Queue.

• Deque (Double-Ended Queue).

Applications: Scheduling algorithms, resource sharing in operating systems.

```

4. Linked List: A collection of nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

```html

Types:

• Singly Linked List: Points only to the next node.

• Doubly Linked List: Points to both next and previous nodes.

• Circular Linked List: Last node points to the frst node.

Advantages: Dynamic size, efficient insertion/deletion.

Disadvantages: Higher memory usage due to pointers.

<table>
<tr><td>

<br> ⏺️ An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a high-level description of a data structure that specifes its behavior from the user’s perspective without focusing on its implementation. 

<br> ⏺️ It defnes a set of values and operations that can be performed on the data, abstracting away the underlying details.

<details>
  <summary> Click to Expand 🔻</summary>

<br> 🟠 Key Characteristics:

```html

1. Encapsulation: Combines data and the operations that manipulate the data into a single unit.

2. Abstraction: Emphasizes “what” operations the ADT can perform rather than “how” they are implemented.

3. Independence: Implementation can vary as long as the ADT behavior is preserved.

4. Focus on Functionality: Specifes operations, their inputs, outputs, and expected behavior, independent of programming language or system constraints.

```

<br> 🟠 Components:

```html

1. Domain (Data): The set of all possible values the ADT can hold.
   For example, In a stack, the domain includes all elements that can be stored in the stack.

2. Operations: The set of operations defned for the ADT.
   Each operation has:

• Name: What the operation is called.

• Input: Parameters or data required for the operation.

• Output: The result of the operation.

3. Properties: Rules or axioms that describe the behavior of the operations (e.g., in a queue, the frst element inserted is the frst to be removed).

``` 

<br> 🟠 Examples:

<table>
<tr><td>

1. List ADT:

```html

Domain: A finite sequence of elements.

Operations:

- Insert (add an element at a specific position).

- Delete (remove an element from a specific position).

- Traverse (access each element sequentially).

- Search (find an element in the list).

```

2. Stack ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of elements where elements are added and removed in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.

Operations:

- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.

- Pop: Remove and return the top element.

- Peek/Top: Return the top element without removing it.

- IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

```

3. Queue ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of elements where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front), following a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

Operations:

- Enqueue: Add an element to the rear.

- Dequeue: Remove and return the front element.

- Peek/Front: Return the front element without removing it.

- IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.

```

4. Deque (Double-Ended Queue) ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of elements where elements can be added or removed from both ends.

Operations:

- InsertFront, InsertRear.

- DeleteFront, DeleteRear.

- PeekFront, PeekRear.

```

5. Priority Queue ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of elements with associated priorities.

Operations:

- Insert: Add an element with a priority.

- RemoveHighestPriority: Remove the element with the highest priority.

```

6. Set ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of unique elements.

Operations:

- Insert: Add an element to the set.

- Remove: Delete an element from the set.

- Union: Combine two sets.

- Intersection: Find common elements in two sets.

- Difference: Find elements present in one set but not the other.

```

</td></tr>
</table>

<br> 🟠 Properties of ADTs:

```html

1. Abstract Interface: The ADT specifes what the operations do, not how they are implemented.

2. Independence from Implementation: The ADT does not restrict how the data is stored or manipulated internally.

3. Platform-Independent: The same ADT can be implemented diferently on various platforms or programming languages.

4. Reusability: ADTs provide a reusable interface that can be applied to various contexts.

```

<br> 🟠 Benefts of Using ADTs:

```html

1. Encapsulation: Encapsulates data and operations, allowing developers to work with high-level abstractions.

2. Modularity:Promotes separation between implementation and usage, making code easier to understand and maintain.

3. Flexibility:Multiple implementations can coexist for the same ADT, allowing optimization for diferent use cases.

4. Ease of Use:Users only need to understand the ADT’s operations, not its implementation.
