  <summary>Click to expand üîª</summary>

<br> üü† Data structures can broadly be classifed into two categories:
  
```html

1. Primitive Data Structures
   ‚Ä¢ Basic data types that are directly operated upon by machine-level instructions.
   ‚Ä¢ Examples: Integers, Floats, Characters, Strings, and Boolean.

2. Non-Primitive Data Structures
   ‚Ä¢ More complex data structures built using primitive data types.
   ‚Ä¢ Examples:
      - Linear: Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List.
      - Nonlinear: Tree, Graph.

```

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand üîª</summary>
  
```html

1. Linear Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ Data is arranged sequentially, and each element is connected to its previous and next element.
   ‚Ä¢ Examples: Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists.

2. Nonlinear Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ Data is arranged in a hierarchical manner, with no strict sequence.
   ‚Ä¢ Examples: Trees, Graphs.

3. Static Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ Fixed size; memory is allocated at Compile-time.
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Array.

4. Dynamic Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ Flexible size; memory is allocated and deallocated at Runtime.
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Linked List.

<br> ‚è∫Ô∏è An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a high-level description of a data structure that specifes its behavior from the user‚Äôs perspective without focusing on its implementation. 

<br> ‚è∫Ô∏è It defnes a set of values and operations that can be performed on the data, abstracting away the underlying details.

<details>
  <summary> Click to Expand üîª</summary>

<br> üü† Key Characteristics:

```html

1. Encapsulation: Combines data and the operations that manipulate the data into a single unit.

2. Abstraction: Emphasizes ‚Äúwhat‚Äù operations the ADT can perform rather than ‚Äúhow‚Äù they are implemented.

3. Independence: Implementation can vary as long as the ADT behavior is preserved.

4. Focus on Functionality: Specifes operations, their inputs, outputs, and expected behavior, independent of programming language or system constraints.

```

<br> üü† Components:

```html

1. Domain (Data): The set of all possible values the ADT can hold.
   For example, In a stack, the domain includes all elements that can be stored in the stack.

2. Operations: The set of operations defned for the ADT.
   Each operation has:

‚Ä¢ Name: What the operation is called.

‚Ä¢ Input: Parameters or data required for the operation.

‚Ä¢ Output: The result of the operation.

3. Properties: Rules or axioms that describe the behavior of the operations (e.g., in a queue, the frst element inserted is the frst to be removed).

``` 

<br> üü† Examples:

<table>
<tr><td>

1. List ADT:

```html

Domain: A finite sequence of elements.

Operations:

- Insert (add an element at a specific position).

- Delete (remove an element from a specific position).

- Traverse (access each element sequentially).

- Search (find an element in the list).

```

2. Stack ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of elements where elements are added and removed in a Last In, First Out (LIFO) manner.

Operations:

- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.

- Pop: Remove and return the top element.

- Peek/Top: Return the top element without removing it.

- IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.

```

3. Queue ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of elements where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front), following a First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

Operations:

- Enqueue: Add an element to the rear.

- Dequeue: Remove and return the front element.

- Peek/Front: Return the front element without removing it.

- IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.

```

4. Deque (Double-Ended Queue) ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of elements where elements can be added or removed from both ends.

Operations:

- InsertFront, InsertRear.

- DeleteFront, DeleteRear.

- PeekFront, PeekRear.

```

5. Priority Queue ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of elements with associated priorities.

Operations:

- Insert: Add an element with a priority.

- RemoveHighestPriority: Remove the element with the highest priority.

```

6. Set ADT:

```html

Domain: A collection of unique elements.

Operations:

- Insert: Add an element to the set.

- Remove: Delete an element from the set.

- Union: Combine two sets.

- Intersection: Find common elements in two sets.

- Difference: Find elements present in one set but not the other.

```

</td></tr>
</table>

<br> üü† Properties of ADTs:

```html

1. Abstract Interface: The ADT specifes what the operations do, not how they are implemented.

2. Independence from Implementation: The ADT does not restrict how the data is stored or manipulated internally.

3. Platform-Independent: The same ADT can be implemented diferently on various platforms or programming languages.

4. Reusability: ADTs provide a reusable interface that can be applied to various contexts.

```

<br> üü† Benefts of Using ADTs:

```html

1. Encapsulation: Encapsulates data and operations, allowing developers to work with high-level abstractions.

2. Modularity:Promotes separation between implementation and usage, making code easier to understand and maintain.

3. Flexibility:Multiple implementations can coexist for the same ADT, allowing optimization for diferent use cases.

4. Ease of Use:Users only need to understand the ADT‚Äôs operations, not its implementation.
