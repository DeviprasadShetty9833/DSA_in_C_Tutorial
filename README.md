<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and worked with efciently. 
<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è They determine the organization of data, the operations that can be performed on the data, and the efficiency of these operations.

1. Efficient Data Handling : Data structures allow for efficient organization and manipulation of data, enabling faster
processing.

2. Optimized Resource Usage : Proper data structures reduce memory and processing requirements.

3. Problem Solving : Many computational problems are best addressed by choosing the appropriate data structure.

4. Real-World Applications :

   ‚Ä¢  Databases use trees and hash tables for efcient indexing.

   ‚Ä¢  Search engines rely on graphs for ranking and searching.

   ‚Ä¢  Compilers use stacks to evaluate expressions and manage function calls.

1. Data Organization: The arrangement of data in memory (e.g., continuous blocks in arrays).

2. Data Manipulation: Operations like insertion, deletion, and updating of data.

3. Access Mechanism: Determines how data can be retrieved and stored efciently.

<br> ![Indentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/_2._-Indentation-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)

<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Indentation is used to define blocks of code.
<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block.
<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line.

*Code* : 
```html
if 10 > 5:
    print("I have indentation.")

print("I have no indentation.")
```
> - The 1st print statement is indented by 4 spaces, so they belong to the if block.
> - The 2nd print statement is not indented, so it is outside the if block.
