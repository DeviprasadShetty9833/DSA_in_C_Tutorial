<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è A Data Structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and worked with efciently. 
<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è They determine the organization of data, the operations that can be performed on the data, and the efficiency of these operations.

1. Efficient Data Handling : Data structures allow for efficient organization and manipulation of data, enabling faster
processing.

2. Optimized Resource Usage : Proper data structures reduce memory and processing requirements.

3. Problem Solving : Many computational problems are best addressed by choosing the appropriate data structure.

4. Real-World Applications :

   ‚Ä¢  Databases use trees and hash tables for efcient indexing.

   ‚Ä¢  Search engines rely on graphs for ranking and searching.

   ‚Ä¢  Compilers use stacks to evaluate expressions and manage function calls.

1. Data Organization: The arrangement of data in memory (e.g., continuous blocks in arrays).

2. Data Manipulation: Operations like insertion, deletion, and updating of data.

3. Access Mechanism: Determines how data can be retrieved and stored efciently.

<br> ![1.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/_1.3_-Classifcation_of_Data_Structures-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)   

<details>

<br> Data structures can broadly be classifed into two categories:
  
```html

1. Primitive Data Structures
   ‚Ä¢ Basic data types that are directly operated upon by machine-level instructions.
   ‚Ä¢ Examples: Integers, Floats, Characters, Strings, and Boolean.

2. Non-Primitive Data Structures
   ‚Ä¢ More complex data structures built using primitive data types.
   ‚Ä¢ Examples:
      - Linear: Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue.
      - Nonlinear: Tree, Graph.

```

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>
  
```html

1. Linear Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ Data is arranged sequentially, and each element is connected to its previous and next element.
   ‚Ä¢ Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.

2. Nonlinear Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ Data is arranged in a hierarchical manner, with no strict sequence.
   ‚Ä¢ Examples: Trees, Graphs.

3. Static Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ Fixed size; memory is allocated at Compile-time.
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Array.

4. Dynamic Data Structures:
   ‚Ä¢ Flexible size; memory is allocated and deallocated at Runtime.
   ‚Ä¢ Example: Linked List.

```

<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è A solid understanding of data structures is essential for designing efcient algorithms and writing optimized programs.

<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Selecting the right data structure for a given application is key to balancing speed, memory, and complexity. 

<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è As computational demands grow, the choice and implementation of data structures become increasingly critical in developing scalable solutions.
  
```html

1. Arrays: Used in image processing, databases, and matrix manipulation.

2. Linked Lists: Basis for dynamic memory allocation, such as in compilers and real-time systems.

3. Stacks: Used for managing function calls in programming and expression evaluation.

4. Queues: Implemented in scheduling systems (CPU scheduling, printers).

5. Trees: Used in hierarchical databases, XML parsers, and fle systems.

6. Graphs: Essential for network routing, social media analytics, and web page ranking.

<br> ![Indentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/_2._-Indentation-000080?style=for-the-badge&logo=C&logoColor=white)

<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Indentation is used to define blocks of code.
<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è All statements with the same level of indentation are considered part of the same block.
<br> ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Indentation is achieved using whitespace (spaces or tabs) at the beginning of each line.
<br> <br> 

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand</summary>

*Code* : 
```html
if 10 > 5:
    print("I have indentation.")

print("I have no indentation.")
```
> - The 1st print statement is indented by 4 spaces, so they belong to the if block.
> - The 2nd print statement is not indented, so it is outside the if block.
